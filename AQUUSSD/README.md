Impact
AquaNest empowers small-scale fish farmers with real-time insights, automated control, and data-driven decisions — ensuring freshness, transparency, and sustainability across the fish supply chain.



These sensors are connected to an ESP32 microcontroller, which collects real-time data and sends it to the Samaki Link cloud platform. If the temperature or humidity goes beyond the safe limits, the system automatically sends SMS or email alerts to notify users. The cooling motor inside the box can also be automatically controlled — it turns on when the temperature rises and off when the desired range is achieved, ensuring both freshness and energy efficiency.
DS18B20
To make the system even smarter, we integrated Artificial Intelligence (AI). The AI analyzes data from the sensors to detect patterns, predict potential faults, and provide automatic responses. For example, it can recognize early signs of cooling failure, send alerts before fish spoil, and optimize the motor’s operation to save power. The AI also generates useful insights and reports on storage performance, helping farmers and transporters make better decisions.

Through Samaki Link, we aim to create a smart, sustainable, and reliable cold chain system that improves fish quality, reduces post-harvest losses, and empowers local fish farmers with real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making.

IoT, AI, USSD, and mobile integration — make Samaki Link a powerful and inclusive platform for modernizing fish cold chain management, ensuring freshness, transparency, and sustainability across the entire supply chain.

To make the system accessible to everyone, even in rural areas without internet access, we developed a USSD service that allows users to interact with Samaki Link using basic mobile phones. Through the USSD menu, users can check cold box status, book transportation, confirm deliveries, and receive alerts instantly.
